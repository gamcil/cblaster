"""
This module provides methods for retrieving contextual information about search hits
from the NCBI's Identical Protein Group (IPG) resource and JSON databases created using
cblaster makedb. It also provides methods for filtering and clustering hits based on
user specified thresholds.

The main functionality of this module is wrapped up in the search() function.
Given a list of Hit objects (resulting from a cblaster search), we can call it:

>>> search(hits)

This will:
1. Search the identifiers of the subject hits against the IPG and retrieve results
2. Parse protein groups from the IPG table
3. Create Subject objects for each entry in any given IPG, containing copies of Hit objects, grouped by organism and scaffold
4. Identify clusters based on user thresholds for intergenic distance, copy number, etc
5. De-duplicate clusters within an organism, where all Subject objects in any two clusters are members of the same IPG

Note that cblaster uses Subject objects, not Hit objects, for this step. A Subject
refers to a unique protein in any given organism, which can be hit in a search any
number of times. A Hit object just stores information about one of these hits (query
and subject protein identifiers, score values). In order to prevent redundancy, Subjects
are created for each unique protein found in the search, which then store the Hit
objects linking them to the query sequences.
